# Image-Matrix

Made a dictionary for each color and an empty list with four values, 
a function which takes the image data and the dictonary as parameters which uses a nested loops to loop thorugh 
all image pixels and checks if the values at 0, 1, 2 are between certain ranges and if they are it increments 
each colors list at that index and stores them in the dictionary. We return the dictionary 
at the end of the function after its updated.
